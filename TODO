# pt2

1. Start reading many files simultaneously
     - print them in order
     - ignore errors

2. Start reading many files simultaneously
     - print them in order
     - retry errors
     - write them somewhere when done.

3. Follow a linked list of files
     - each file tells you where the next one is
     - errors will also tell you where to look
     - write the whole list somewhere when done

4. The OTP to read $file is in $keydir. Only one will work, find it.
   We know that the file starts with "...."
   Write the decrypted file to somewhere

   read file
   for each key in keydir
     if key decrypts file, stop.

5. Read a list of files
   Access each file in the list
   Some of them will throw an ENCRYPTED_FILE error
   The keys are in /keys. For each failing file, try to
     decrypt it by writing each key to $file.key
   Write the concatenated list of all decrypted files somewhere.
